# Image Caption Tool

The **Image Caption Tool** is a web application built with React and Fabric.js that allows users to search for images, add them to a canvas, and then add text layers or shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) on top of the image. Users can download the final image with the added elements.

## Features

- **Search Images**: Search for images from the Pexels API using a keyword.
- **Add Images to Canvas**: Select an image from the search results and add it to a canvas.
- **Add Text**: Add editable text layers on the canvas.
- **Add Shapes**: Add basic shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle) to the canvas.
- **Download Image**: Download the modified image with all added layers.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Fabric.js**: For image manipulation on the canvas (adding images, text, and shapes).
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to fetch images from the Pexels API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
